## Bugs
1. ~~Fix stickers, apng -> gif conversion is losing quality and frame/animation information.~~ Not supported.
2. ~~Fix EmoteWindow not processing guild selection when double clicking a new guild in the main window if the EmoteWindow is already open.~~ Seems to have been fixed..? I don't remember working to fix this but it works now. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
3. ~~Export seems to be broken in general now.~~
4. ~~Emote preview no longer displaying preview images but new images are being added.~~
5. ~~Config option for automatic token retrieval isn't updating once enabled.~~
6. ~~Automatic token retrieval borked somehow.~~ Restarting Discord seems to have fixed this? Possible bug on Discord's end?

## Features
1. Automatic conversion from apng to gif (hopefully without losing quality).

## Other
1. ~~Finish continue function so that the whole process doesn't have to restart if the program closes.~~
2. Better organize emote preview panel.
