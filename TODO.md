# TODO:

## Bugs
1. Fix stickers, apng -> gif conversion is losing quality and frame/animation information.
2. ~~Fix EmoteWindow not processing guild selection when double clicking a new guild in the main window if the EmoteWindow is already open.~~ Seems to have been fixed..? I don't remember working to fix this but it works now. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
3. Export seems to be broken in general now.
4. Emote preview no longer displaying preview images but new images are being added.

## Features
~~1. Add automatic token retrieval option.~~

## Other
